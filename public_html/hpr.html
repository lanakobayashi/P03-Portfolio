                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>HPR is a trail resource mobile app for hikers and trekkers that helps them plan their trip. By sharing trail information and their planning mindset of experienced trekkers to the casual outdoor enthusiasts, the app supports all hikers to explore safely.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>Through interviews and research, we found that people have a lack of knowledge with packing sufficiently and it’s difficult to find credible sources on preparation information. This is due to the large amount of effort required to research the key areas for hiking safely.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-highlight">
                        <h1>Our design domain: outdoor enthusiasts and experienced trekkers who are researching trail information so that they can avoid dangerous situations.</h1>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h2>User Frictions and Touchpoints</h2>
                        <p>Using a user experience journey map, we framed the user flow of our two personas to determine where we want to place our focus. </p>

                        <div class="works-image">
                            <img src="img/journey%20map-01.png" alt="Kitchen Stories mockup">
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="works-image">
                            <img src="img/journey%20map-02.png" alt="Kitchen Stories mockup">
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>For outdoor enthusiasts, they would be asking questions such as “What do I need?” throughout the planning stage which develops from the feeling of uncertainty throughout the process due to their lack of knowledge. </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        For experienced trekkers, their thoughts would be less about uncertainty and more about using the app as an additional resource and acting as a contributor to the app for information. Therefore, we added a touchpoint in the post-hike stage in which they can share their checklist of what they brought to the trek so that other hikers may reference what they had brought later on along with the metrics that they tracked.
