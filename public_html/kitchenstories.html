                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>Kitchen Stories is a video-based cooking app that offers its users original recipes with high quality step-by-step photos and videos. Its purpose is to make cooking more accessible and connect with professional chefs, food bloggers, and food lovers from all around the world.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Insights</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>We looked into beginner and expert users to understand when and why they would open this application. Through interviews, we found that most of the beginner users didnâ€™t have any issues with usability. On the other hand, the interface did not support expert users who come back to the application to refresh their memory for a recipe that they've previously used.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Deriving a problem from insights</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>We conducted exploratory and evaluative research to find any usability issues that exist in the current application. Through our research, we found two major concerns that the users encountered. We decided to focus on our first concern, which addresses the issue of the limitations with flexibility on how much the user can customize the interface to their preferences after using it more than once.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>For our solution, we proposed the Memo feature, which is an easy-note taking system that allows users to modify the existing recipes to their preferences and save these changes so the user can revisit the information at their convenience. Users can easily enter notes directly on the recipe and save them for future reference, with an option to revert back to the original recipe at any given time.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>Working under a time constraint in a team of two really pushed me to work fast and efficiently while exploring all the possibilities. We learned to quickly reject good ideas that did not fit within the scope and move on to the next by being observant.
