                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>photogra-VR is a virtual reality headset inspired by the usage of a camera, in both its form and presentation of natural materials. It brings together a stained oak finish contrasting a clean washi centerfold. The headset has the ability to be taken apart and compressed so it can be stored easily and for portability in travel. The camera style grip and strap allow for quickly switching between VR spaces and the real world.</p>

                    <h2>Prompt</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>This project was completed for a course called Materials in Design. For the final project, we were asked to design and construct a virtual reality headset using two randomly selected materials. As the team's ideator and visual designer, I was tasked with designing a product that maximized the use of the materials while developing an art direction that fit with the overall concept and image.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>Given wood and paper as our two materials, we analyzed personas that would use a headset in an environment where using the two materials for the device made logical sense. To enhance the naturality and organic properties of the materials we decided to focus on the field of travel, specifically photographers who are scouting for possible outdoor shooting locations around the world.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sketches</h3>
                        <p>Through our iteration process, the team individually explored forms that can maximize the potential of its properties. During the ideation process, I examined how the folding mechanism of paper can be used to collapse or minimize the size of the headset to create a portable device. I decided to adapt the concept of detachable components and the foldability of the paper to promote portability with the headset. The team collectively chose to move forward with one of my forms, while integrating concepts from other team members' sketches to maximize usability. </p>

                        <h3>Material Choise</h3>
                        <p>For our wood, we decided to move forward with oak because of its durability and warmth. We also used cedar for the handle because of its comfortable touch that seemed ideal for a good grip. The components were laser cut and finished with a tea stain for a more natural look. As for paper, we observed properties of various types and decided on washi. The natural and neutral colour and feel of the paper appealed to us as a good candidate to match with wood.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Laser cuts and Folds</h3>
                        <p>The wood components were laser cut and finished with a tea stain for a more natural look. For collapsibility, we used one single sheet of washi paper that was hand-folded in the form of an accordion. By using a single sheet, it provided enough robustness to support the wooden structure. All our components were then attached together using glue.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>photogra-VR promotes portability and more sporadic use of VR to allow for usage in indoor and outdoor settings. The camera-esque form allows users to feel like they are aiming a camera in virtual spaces, which provides affordance and familiarity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Strategically crafting a product with creative yet efficient application of materials led us to a successful completion of this project. While constantly encountering challenges along the way, the team was able to overcome them by being open-minded to new ideas.</p>
