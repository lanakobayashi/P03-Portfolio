            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>Kitchen Stories is a video-based cooking app that offers its users original recipes with high quality step-by-step photos videos. Its purpose is to make cooking more accessible and connect with professional chefs, food bloggers, and food lovers from all around the world.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>We conducted exploratory and evaluative research to find any usability issues that exist in the current application. Through our research, we found that the current app has limitations on how much the user can customize the interface to their preferences after using it more than once. </p>   
            </div>
            
             <h2>Insights</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>We looked into beginner and expert users to understand when and why they would open this application. Through interviews, we found that most of the beginner users didnâ€™t have any issues with usability. On the other hand, the interface did not support expert users who come back to the application to refresh their memory for a recipe that they've previously used.</p>   
            </div>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>For our solution, we proposed the Memo feature, which is an easy-note taking system that allows users to modify the existing recipes to their preferences and save these changes so the user can revisit the information at their convenience. Users can easily enter notes directly on the recipe and save them for future reference, with an option to revert back to the original recipe at any given time.</p>   
            </div>
      
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>Working under a time constraint in a team of two really pushed me to work fast and efficiently while exploring all the possibilities. We learned quickly to reject good ideas that did not fit within the scope and move on to the next by being observant.

            <p>Ideation, UX Research, Visual Design</p>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>photogra-VR is a virtual reality headset inspired by the usage of a camera, in both its form and presentation of natural materials. It brings together a stained oak finish contrasting a clean washi centerfold. The headset has the ability to be taken apart and compressed so it can be stored easily and for portability in travel. The camera style grip and strap allow for quickly switching between VR spaces and the real world.</p>   
            </div>
            
            <h2>Prompt</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>This project was completed for a course called Materials in Design. For the final project, we were asked to design and construct a virtual reality headset using two randomly selected materials. As the team's ideator and visual designer, I was tasked with craft a product that maximized the use of the materials while developing an art direction that fit with the overall concept and image.</p>   
            </div>
            
             <h2>Design Process</h2>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>Through our iteration process, the team individually sketched multiple ideas that are worth creating for this project. While ideating, I observed various ways of how portable devices can be collapsed or minimized. I decided to adapt the concept of detachable components and the foldability of the paper to promote more portability with the headset. The team collectively chose to move forward with one of my form, while integrating concepts from other team members' sketches to maximize portability and usability. </p> 
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>For our wood, we decided to move forward with oak because of its durability and comforting warmth. We also used cedar for the handle because of its warm touch due to its high thermal properties. The components were laser cut and finished with a tea stain for a more natural look. For collapsibility, we used one single sheet of washi paper that was hand-folded in the form of an accordion. By using a single sheet, its robustness and portability was enhanced. All our components were then attached together using glue.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>photogra-VR promotes portability and more sporadic use of VR so it can be used in indoor and outdoor settings. The camera-style form allows users to feel like they are aiming a camera in virtual spaces.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Strategically crafting a product with creative yet efficient application of materials led us to a successful completion of this project. While constantly encountering challenges along the way, the team was able to overcome them by being open-minded to new ideas.</p>
